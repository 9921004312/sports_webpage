    <h1>Sports help in maintaining Good Health</h1>
    <p>
      In todayâ€™s era of excessive competition and changing environment, people
      barely care about our health and have to face its consequences in the
      later stages of their life. They easily become prey to many
      life-threatening health issues. Those who are indulged in regular physical
      activities can easily defend themselves from such diseases. Therefore,
      playing sports can resolve this concern. Playing regular sports can help
      maintain diabetes, improve heart function, and reduce stress and tension
      in an individual.
