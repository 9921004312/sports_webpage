    <p>
      The heart is the most important organ of our body. With changing
      lifestyles, people are facing heart-related problems these days. The life
      of heart patients becomes difficult with lots of heavy medications and
      restrictions. Therefore, people need to indulge in outdoor games. Playing
      for even 30 minutes a day can do wonders for your life. The heart pumps
      better, and blood circulation improves whenever we play sports. Heart
      muscles get stronger, and hence it starts functioning at a better rate.
