    <h1>Enhance your Immunity</h1>
    <p>
      The immune system is the major player of the body in fighting infections.
      Those who easily catch infections and fall sick frequently can easily get
      healthier by working on their immune system. It becomes really difficult
      to live with poor immunity, take heavy medications frequently, and spend
      most of your time indoors just to prevent yourself from the effects of
      changing environments. Getting indulged in regular sports activities can
      help build your immunity greatly, and the most amazing part with it is
      that you can do it by just playing your favourite sport.
