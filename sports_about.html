        Sports is such an activity that it can be taken up by anyone; at any
      age and any point in life. Adults, children and elders – everyone
      alike can take part in sports. Many regard sports as a mere
      co-curricular or extra-curricular activity in schools. However, in
      reality, sports play an equally important role as does education in a
      person’s life. To achieve overall and all-round development in life,
      one should be well-versed in both sports and culture. While training
      sharpens the mind, sports sharpens the body and fitness. Thus, both
      are essential. </blockquote>
      <blockquote> 
        There are numerous advantages of involving oneself in
      sports. First and foremost, as known by all and very definitively,
      competitions increase the physical fitness of an individual.
      Additionally, sports also contribute to building stable mental
      well-being of a person. Various researchers show that people who are
      in the daily practice of sports in any form record better mental as
      well as physical health. Moreover, sports also eliminates the risk of
      a person catching diseases or facing any bodily interruptions.
      Competitions increase immunity and increase people’s stamina.</blockquote>
